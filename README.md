# Introduction

This open-source framework helps students and universities in Malaysia set up and run Blockchain Clubs fast and effectively. Whether youâ€™re starting from scratch or improving an existing club, this repo gives you all the tools:

# Club Setup Guide

## Step 1: Define the Purpose
- What is the club about?
- Who is it for?
- What do you hope to achieve?

## Step 2: Find Founding Members
Usually, youâ€™ll need a minimum number of interested people (e.g., 3-5)
They become the first officers or executive team

## Step 3: Draft a Club Constitution
This is like the clubâ€™s rulebook. It covers:
- Club name & purpose
- Membership criteria
- Roles & responsibilities (President, Treasurer, etc.)
- Meeting frequency


## Step 4: Elect Officers
- President
- Vice President
- Secretary
- Treasurer
- Technical Lead:	Oversees workshops, hands-on sessions, and technical content (e.g., smart contracts, Solidity, Rust, etc.)
- Research Lead:	Stays updated on blockchain trends, prepares newsletters, deep dives, and organizes reading groups
- Marketing & Social Media Lead:	Runs X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Instagram or Discord promotion for events and club content
- Design & Content Lead:	Creates posters, slide decks, infographics, and memes (yes, blockchain memes are culture ðŸ˜Ž)
- Events Lead:	Plans internal competitions, joins external hackathons, handles event logistics

## Step 5: Get Approval (if needed)
For school/university/community clubs, you might need to:
- Register the club
- Get a faculty advisor or supervisor

## Step 6: Start Holding Meetings
Plan events, recruit members, and run activities!
