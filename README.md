# Introduction

This open-source framework helps students and universities in Malaysia set up and run Blockchain Clubs fast and effectively. Whether you’re starting from scratch or improving an existing club, this repo gives you all the tools:

# Club Setup Guide

## Step 1: Define the Purpose
- What is the club about?
- Who is it for?
- What do you hope to achieve?

## Step 2: Find Founding Members
Usually, you’ll need a minimum number of interested people (e.g., 3-5)
They become the first officers or executive team

## Step 3: Draft a Club Constitution
This is like the club’s rulebook. It covers:
- Club name & purpose
- Membership criteria
- Roles & responsibilities (President, Treasurer, etc.)
- Meeting frequency


## Step 4: Elect Officers
- President
- Vice President
- Secretary
- Treasurer
- Technical Lead:	Oversees workshops, hands-on sessions, and technical content (e.g., smart contracts, Solidity, Rust, etc.)
- Research Lead:	Stays updated on blockchain trends, prepares newsletters, deep dives, and organizes reading groups
- Marketing & Social Media Lead:	Runs X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Instagram or Discord promotion for events and club content
- Design & Content Lead:	Creates posters, slide decks, infographics, and memes (yes, blockchain memes are culture 😎)
- Events Lead:	Plans internal competitions, joins external hackathons, handles event logistics

## Step 5: Get Approval (if needed)
For school/university/community clubs, you might need to:
- Register the club
- Get a faculty advisor or supervisor

## Step 6: Start Holding Meetings
Plan events, recruit members, and run activities!
